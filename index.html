    <h1>In Praise of Ahmada, by Nana Asma’u</h1>
    <p>Nana Asma’u bint Fodio is the daughter of the famous
         Hausa-Fulani revolutionary Usman Dan Fodio. 
         She is a great female poet and scholar. 
         The name ‘ahmada’ used in the poem is an Arabic variant of the name Muhammad. 
         This is an excerpt from the poem, and it's a translation from its original language, Hausa/Fulani.</p>
        <i>His light exceeds the light of the full moon
            <br>There is no light like the light of Muhammad.
            <br>As for bravery, no warrior has ever matched the courage shown by Ahmada.
            <br>Musk and myrrh do not equal
            <br>The perfume emitted by the body of Muhammad. 
            <br>As for his beauty and physique, he surpassed all
            <br>For nowhere is there the like of Muhammad.
            <br>There has never been created a man like him
            <br>And none will ever be created like Ahmada.
            <br>As for his wisdom, there is none like him
            <br>Cheerful and smiling was Muhammad.
           <br> He was never angry. Only sin caused his righteous anger.</i>
